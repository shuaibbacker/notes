What Is Git?
Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 . It allows developers to track changes in their code, collaborate with others, and manage project history efficiently. Unlike centralized systems, Git provides each developer with a full copy of the repository, enabling offline work and robust collaboration .


Key Git Concepts
Repository (repo): A storage space for your project, containing all files and their history.

Commit: A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.

Branch: A parallel line of development, allowing you to work on features independently.

Merge: Combining changes from different branches.

Clone: Copying an existing repository to your local machine.

Pull: Fetching and integrating changes from a remote repository.

Push: Sending your local commits to a remote repository.
